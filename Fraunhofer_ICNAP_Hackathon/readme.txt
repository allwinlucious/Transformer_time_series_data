Dataset description:

This data was originally used in a competition in the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence, 2008. 
The classification problem is to diagnose whether a certain symptom exists or does not exist in an automotive subsystem. 
Each case consists of 500 measurements of engine noise and a classification. There are two separate problems: 
For FordA the Train and test data set were collected in typical operating conditions, with minimal noise contamination.

Judging Criteria:

1. Completion of the task with available standard metrics

2. Good metrics of the model with timeseries transformer

2. Efficiency of the code

3. Bonus task completion
